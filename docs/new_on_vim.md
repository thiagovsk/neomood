## What is NeoMood?

NeoMood is a modern Neovim configuration that makes editing faster and more intuitive. Key features:

- **Leader Key**: `<Space>` (your main command key)
- **Flash Jump**: Press `s` to jump anywhere on screen
- **Smart Features**: Auto-completion, syntax highlighting, file explorer

## Getting Started

**Important**: This tutorial teaches you to use NeoMood. The most important thing to remember is that pressing `<ESC>` will always get you out of trouble.

## Understanding Neovim's Core Principles

Neovim follows a simple but powerful grammar system that makes it incredibly efficient once you understand the pattern.

### The Neovim Grammar: [COUNT] + ACTION + MOVEMENT

Neovim commands follow this structure:
- **COUNT** (optional): How many times to repeat
- **ACTION**: What to do (delete, change, yank, etc.)
- **MOVEMENT**: Where to operate (word, line, character, etc.)

### Basic Actions
```
d - delete
c - change (delete and enter insert mode)
y - yank (copy)
v - visual select
```

### Basic Movements
```
w - word forward
b - word backward
e - end of word
$ - end of line
0 - beginning of line
j - down one line
k - up one line
```

### Examples of the Grammar in Action

**Movement with Count:**
- `3w` - move 3 words forward
- `5j` - move 5 lines down
- `2b` - move 2 words backward

**Action + Movement:**
- `dw` - delete word
- `cw` - change word
- `y$` - yank to end of line
- `d0` - delete to beginning of line

**Count + Action + Movement:**
- `3dw` - delete 3 words
- `2cw` - change 2 words
- `5dd` - delete 5 lines
- `3yy` - yank 3 lines

### Why This Grammar is Powerful

Once you learn this pattern, you can combine any count, action, and movement:
- `d3w` - delete 3 words forward
- `c2j` - change 2 lines down
- `y5k` - yank 5 lines up
- `v3e` - visually select 3 words to the end

### Special Cases

Some commands work alone:
- `dd` - delete entire line
- `yy` - yank entire line
- `cc` - change entire line
- `x` - delete character under cursor

This grammar makes Neovim incredibly expressive and efficient!

## Lesson 1: Basic Movement

### Lesson 1.1: FIRST STEPS

** Type: nvim <ENTER> to start NeoMood **

  1. Make sure your caps-lock key is NOT depressed.

  2. Press the <ESC> key to make sure you are in Normal mode.
type: Welcome 
  3. Type: i <ENTER> to enter Insert mode.

  4. Type: Welcome to NeoMood!

  5. Press <ESC> to go back to Normal mode.

  6. Type: :w test.txt <ENTER> to save the file.

NOTE: You are now in Normal mode. This is where most NeoMood commands work.

### Lesson 1.2: BASIC CURSOR MOVEMENT

** The cursor is moved using either the arrow keys or the hjkl keys. **

	     ^
	     k		    Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
   < h   l >		   The l key is at the right and moves right.
	     j			   The j key looks like a down arrow
	     v

  1. Move the cursor around the text until you are comfortable.

  2. Hold down the down key (j) until it repeats.

  3. Now you know how to move to the next lesson.

  4. Using the down key, move to Lesson 1.3.

NOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <ESC> to place
      you in Normal mode.  Then retype the command you wanted.

By default, searches are case sensitive. You can:

  1. Type /cat to find "cat" but not "Cat"
  2. Type /\ccat to ignore case (finds "cat", "Cat", "CAT")
  3. Type /\Ccat to force case sensitivity

10. Copy entire paragraph using visual line mode (V)

NOTE: Remember - y copies, p pastes after cursor, P pastes before cursor!

## Working with Indentation

### The Power of `vij`

`vij` is a magical command that selects all lines at the same indentation level:

```
vi{  - Select inside braces
vij  - Select same indentation level
vaI  - Select around indentation (with blank lines)
```

### Indentation Practice

**Using the function block in your practice text:**

1. **Select indentation block**: Put cursor on `line1_here` and press `vij`
2. **Select with braces**: Put cursor inside the `if (condition)` block and press `vi{`
3. **Move selection**: In visual mode, press `J` to move lines down, `K` to move up
4. **Indent selection**: Select lines with `V`, then press `>` to indent, `<` to outdent

**Try these specific exercises:**
- Put cursor on `line1_here` and press `vij` to select the indented block
- Put cursor inside `{` after `if (condition)` and press `vi{` to select everything inside braces
- Select the three lines with `line1_here`, `line2_here`, `line3_here` and press `>` to indent them more
- Select the same lines and press `<` to outdent them

**Pro tip**: After selecting with `vij`, you can:
- Press `>` to indent the whole block
- Press `<` to outdent the whole block
- Press `J` to move the whole block down
- Press `K` to move the whole block up

## Editing Text

### Search and Navigation Practice

**File Finding:**
1. Press `<Space><Space>` to find files
   - Type part of filename (fuzzy matching works!)
   - Press `Enter` to open
   - Press `<Space>sr` for recent files

**Content Search:**
1. Press `<Space>sp` to search text in all files
   - Type your search term
   - See live results as you type
   - Press `Enter` to jump to result

**Buffer Search:**
1. Press `<Space>ss` to search in current file only
2. Press `<Space>so` to search in all open buffers

**Word Search:**
1. Put cursor on any word
2. Press `<Space>sw` to search for that word everywhere

**Traditional Search:**
1. Press `/` and type search term
2. Press `n` for next result, `N` for previous
3. Press `?` to search backwards

**Pro tip**: FZF search (`<Space>sp`) is usually better than traditional search (`/`) for finding things across multiple files.

### Daily Workflow

**Opening and exploring:**
1. Open: `nvim` or `nvim filename`
2. Explore: `<Space>e` for file tree or `<Space><Space>` for fuzzy find
3. Navigate: Use `s` for flash jump, `hjkl` for movement

**Editing:**
1. Edit: `i` to insert, `Esc` to normal mode
2. Select: `v` for character, `V` for line, `vij` for indentation
3. Copy/Paste: `yy` to copy, `p` to paste
4. Save: `\` to save all files

**Advanced:**
1. Search: `<Space>sp` to search across files
2. Git: `<Space><Tab>` for git status
3. Close: `<Space>k` to close buffer, `<Space>qq` to quit

## Quick Tips

✅ **Do:**
- Use `hjkl` instead of arrow keys
- Master flash jump (`s`) - it's a game changer
- Use `<Space>` for most advanced features
- Practice `vij` for indentation selection
- Use `<Space>sp` for searching across files

❌ **Don't:**
- Stay in Insert mode for navigation
- Ignore the leader key (`<Space>`)
- Use arrow keys or mouse
- Fight the configuration - trust NeoMood

## Final Words

NeoMood transforms Neovim into a modern, efficient development environment. The key is **gradual learning**:

1. **Start simple**: Master modes and basic movement
2. **Build muscle memory**: Practice the fundamentals daily
3. **Add complexity**: Gradually learn advanced features
4. **Stay consistent**: 15 minutes daily beats 2 hours weekly

Remember: Vim has a steep learning curve, but once you climb it, you'll never want to go back!
